Insights:

1. **Sales Growth Volatility**

Products Ordered: There are significant fluctuations, with dramatic drops in February (-60%) and May (-75%), and notable growth in March (+103%) and June (+14%). The overall trend appears unstable, with extreme highs and lows, indicating inconsistent demand or supply chain issues.

Revenue Growth: There is a similar pattern in revenue growth, with peaks in March (+83%) and June (+50%), followed by sharp declines in May (-60%) and September (-68%). These patterns highlight potential seasonality or operational inefficiencies impacting sales and revenue.

2. **Profit and Cost Analysis**

Profits: The company experienced highly volatile profits, with a massive gain in June (+311%) and drastic declines, particularly in March (-192%) and May (-82%). This suggests unstable cost management, potential underpricing, or irregular demand.

Operating Costs: The company's operating costs seem to fluctuate wildly, with very high growth in January (+517%) and May (+329%), followed by significant cost reductions in April (-89%). There appears to be poor cost control or unpredictable expenses, possibly driven by inconsistent procurement or production costs.

3. **Overall Negative Growth**

Month-on-Month Sales Growth: The company is currently experiencing a decline in overall sales growth (-9.10%), which is reflected in the purchase growth decline (-13.50%) and profit growth decline (-14.52%).

Operating Cost Management: While the costs are more controlled (-2.32% month-on-month), the lack of stability in profits, sales, and demand is likely dragging the company down.




## Recommendations:

1. **Stabilize Demand**

Introducing promotions or partnerships with retailers during low-demand months could help stabilize sales.


2. **Optimize Cost Management**

The company must focus on controlling operating expenses, especially given the volatility seen in early months. Engaging in more strategic supplier negotiations, bulk purchasing during high-demand months, and reducing waste during low-demand periods would help reduce costs.



3. **Improve Profit Margin**

Since the profits are highly erratic, the company could benefit from a more refined pricing strategy. Analyzing competitors' pricing, revisiting product packaging, and introducing premium offerings could improve margins.



4. **Operational Efficiency**

Explore operational improvements to reduce production lead time and costs. This may include better supplier contracts, streamlining logistics, and reducing labor inefficiencies. As the business scales, the goal should be to maintain steady cost management even during periods of fluctuating sales.



5. **Diversification**

Consider diversifying the product portfolio to smooth out seasonality effects. Introducing new date-related products such as snacks, spreads, or beverages could attract different customer segments and provide a buffer against market volatility.
